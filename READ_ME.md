This project is done for submission in tech with time code jam


Details:-
This project track your face or a color from webcam and gets its location.
Then it visualizes a 3d room with a few objects in it, and the move according to your face/object movement.
It's a fun project and first time I have ever used openpygl for it.

Here are the instructions:-

1. First install pygame, PyOpenGL, numpy, opencv-python and pillow
2. Make sure all the files are in the order as github repo
3. For using the program by simply detecting face, you can run this command
   (python main.py face)
4. If you want to run it using mask, first run mask.py and adjust the perimeter and when u are happy with it press q to exit and it will save the configuration
5. Then run it by this command (python main.py mask)
6. That's it hope u enjoy and check my other projects I have done




Thanks
